I made this, first out of boredom, but now I genuinly want to make a good theme, it also looks different across client versions :D

Standard Discord Client: Blurple / #7289DA

Discord Canary: (Made up by me) Canary Gold / #EFB65F

Public Test Build: Greyple / #99AAB5

[Stylus Install](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kckarnige/kckarnige.github.io/master/femboi_owo/improved-dc-ui/index.user.css)
[BetterDiscord Download](https://betterdiscord.net/ghdl/?url=https://github.com/kckarnige/kckarnige.github.io/raw/master/femboi_owo/improved-dc-ui/improvedui.theme.css)

*[Greyple and Blurple](https://discord.com/branding) is Discord stuff or some shit like that*
